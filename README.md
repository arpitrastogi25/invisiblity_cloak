# invisiblity_cloak
Created a simple Invisibility cloak code like that used by Harry Potter using opencv-python.

1. You can choose to calibrate the HSV value of the color of the cloak. By sliding the TrackBars in the 'Calibrate' window you can adjust them such that the cloak region appears white in the 'mask' window whereas everything appears black.

2. Then you need to capture a background image which will be visible through the region covered by the cloak making the foreground invisible.
